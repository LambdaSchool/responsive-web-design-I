        <p> Finally, let’s look at the class names. Since there is so little content on this site, it doesn’t seem like that matters, but consider what would happen if we started to add styling, or build out whole classes. Before moving on, change the class “something” to “subtitle”. This helps not only screen readers, but your future developer self.</p>

        <p>Screen readers are a great thing to keep top of mind while designing for accessibility. A screen reader is a tool (a browser extension or app) that transmits web page data for people with visual impairments, learning disabilities, or other needs; They usually operate by verbalizing the content or sometimes translating into braille.

        <p>The idea of accessibility in web originated because people with disabilities needed to be able to access the internet in non-traditional ways. Unsurprisingly though, designing accessible websites has compounding benefits and it helps a plethora of other people.

        <h1>Vision</h1>
        <p>Other universal benefits of accessibility include designs intended for permanent physical impairments that help people with temporary issues (like a broken thumb) and designs intended for the hearing impaired, for example closed captioning, that help everyone when they’re in a loud space or can’t use headphones.</p>
