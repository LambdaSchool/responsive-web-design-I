					<p>Create a tablet and mobile version of the services page from previous projects</p>
					<p>Once you have completed the project with max-width media queries, start over with min-width media queries to get a feel for how a mobile first approach would be like. </p>
					<p>I recommend making a copy of all your contents in a new folder named "mobile-first" to keep it separate</p>

					The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a 
					thousand ships with more fire power than I've... 
					There's another ship coming in. Maybe they know what happened. 
					It's an Imperial fighter. It followed us! 
					No. It's a short range fighter. There aren't any bases around here. 
					Where did it come from?

					Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this. Blast it, 
					will you! My gun's jammed. 
					Where? Anywhere! Oh!! Luke! Luke! Grab him! 
					What happened? 
					I've got a very bad feeling about this. The walls are moving! 
					Don't just stand there. Try to brace it with something. 
					Wait a minute! Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could 
					he be?

						What about the tower? 
						You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower! 
						Artoo...that, that stabilizer's broken loose again! See if you 
						can't lock it down! 
						I'm hit! I can't stay with you. Get clear, Wedge. 
						Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not 
						in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. 
						I'm in it for the money!
