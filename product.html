					The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. 
					It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've... 
					There's another ship coming in. Maybe they know what happened. 
					It's an Imperial fighter. It followed us! 
					No. It's a short range fighter. There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from? 
					It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble.

					Not if I can help it. 
					Chewie...jam it's transmissions. It'd be as well to let it go.
					It's too far out of range. 
					Not for long...
					Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this. 
					Blast it, will you! 
					My gun's jammed. Where? Anywhere! 
					Oh!! Luke! Luke! Grab him! What happened? 
					I've got a very bad feeling about this. 
					The walls are moving! Don't just stand there. 
					Try to brace it with something. Wait a minute! 
					Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be?
					Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in. We're going in full throttle.

					Right with you, boss.

				<p>
					Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time? </p>
				<p>
					It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home. We'll stay back far enough to cover you.
				</p>
				<p>
					My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port!
				</p>
				<p>
					Are you sure the computer can hit it? 
					Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle! What about the tower? 
					You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower! 
					Artoo...that, that stabilizer's broken loose again! See if you can't lock it down! 
					I'm hit! I can't stay with you. Get clear, Wedge. 
					You can't do any more good back there! Sorry!
					He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the 
					ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.

					The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. 
					A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. I don't think 
					you boys can help. I must go alone. 
					Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already. 
					Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids. But he can...
					Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself. 
					That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go. It's the only explanation 
					for the ease of our escape. Easy...you call that easy?

					Their tracking us! 
					Not this ship, sister. At least the information in Artoo is still intact. 
					What's so important? What's he carrying? 
					The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the 
					data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It's not over yet! 
					It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not 
					in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. 
					I'm in it for the money! You needn't worry about your reward. 
					If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!
